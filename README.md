Hi, everyone
I have sucessfully completed a Prediction model project using ANN.
The main problem statement of the project is to predict whether a customer would like to churn the company or not.

**Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company. 
It is a crucial metric for businesses across various industries, especially those with subscription-based models such as telecommunications, software as a service (SaaS), and media streaming services.

Customer churn can occur for various reasons, including dissatisfaction with the product or service, better offers from competitors, changes in personal circumstances, or inadequate customer support.
High churn rates can negatively impact a company's revenue and profitability, as acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones.**

I have used pandas, scikitleanr, matplotlib, tensorflow and seaborn to implement the project.
THANK YOU.
